# README GENERATOR

## Description
Ever needed a project to generate a README, well look no further but here as the new README generator creates and generates READMEs to provide you with your needs. It does exactly what it does, creates a read me by asking a series of questions and then giving you all the autonomy to choose the license, the program, and so much more. This is useful as people can use it to style and create their own READMEs for their project.I learned a lot about fs and inquirer and learned the ways to use them to get what I want from my code.
